# MatchGame

This is an animal matching game, where a player is shown a grid of 16 animals and needs to click on pairs to make them disappear. 

The game shows eight different pairs of animals scattered randomly around the window. The player clicks on two animalsâ€”if they 
match, they disappear from the window. 

This timer keeps track of how long it takes the player to finish the game. The goal is to find all of the matches in as little time as 
possible.

ðŸ‘‰What is XAML file? <a><br></a>
"XAML" stands for Extensible Application Markup Language. XAML is a markup language developed by Microsoft that is used to describe the user interface (UI) of applications, particularly in the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) framework.

In a XAML file, developers can define the UI elements of an application such as windows, buttons, text boxes, images, and more. XAML code can be used to create rich, interactive user interfaces with advanced features such as animation and data binding.

XAML is often used in conjunction with a programming language such as C# or VB.NET to create Windows desktop applications, as well as Windows Store and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps.
